# AI Image Generation Diagnostic Framework - Documentation Summary

## Documentation Overview

This documentation package provides comprehensive client-side troubleshooting guidance for AI image generation systems after deployment script completion.

### Key Documents Created

1. **[DIAGNOSTIC_FRAMEWORK_GUIDE.md](DIAGNOSTIC_FRAMEWORK_GUIDE.md)** - Complete user guide (267 lines)
2. **[DIAGNOSTIC_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](DIAGNOSTIC_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Essential commands and quick fixes (204 lines)

## Cross-Reference Validation

### Deployment Script Integration ✓

Both documents correctly reference:
- **Intel**: [`deployment/intel/scripts/prepare_intel.ps1`](../../deployment/intel/scripts/prepare_intel.ps1)
- **Snapdragon**: [`deployment/snapdragon/scripts/prepare_snapdragon.ps1`](../../deployment/snapdragon/scripts/prepare_snapdragon.ps1)

### Performance Expectations ✓

Consistent across all documentation:
- **Intel Systems**: 35-45 seconds per 768x768 image (DirectML)
- **Snapdragon Systems**: 3-5 seconds per image (NPU)

### File Path Consistency ✓

Standard client deployment locations:
- **Virtual Environment**: `C:\AIDemo\venv\`
- **Client Files**: `C:\AIDemo\client\`
- **Intel Models**: `C:\AIDemo\models\sdxl-base-1.0\` (~6.9GB)
- **Snapdragon Models**: `C:\AIDemo\models\` (~400-500MB each)

### Command Syntax Validation ✓

Essential commands verified consistent:
```bash
# Post-deployment validation
python demo_diagnostic.py --quick

# Detailed troubleshooting
python demo_diagnostic.py --detailed-report

# Debug mode
python demo_diagnostic.py --detailed-report --log-level DEBUG

# Support data collection
python demo_diagnostic.py --detailed-report --log-level DEBUG --save-logs
```

### Platform-Specific Guidance ✓

**Intel DirectML**:
- Dependency: `torch-directml`
- Provider: DirectML GPU acceleration
- Common Issues: Driver conflicts, maintenance mode, GPU memory

**Snapdragon NPU**:
- Dependency: `onnxruntime-qnn`
- Provider: QNN execution provider
- Common Issues: Windows 11 24H2 requirement, NPU drivers, ARM64 compatibility

## Documentation Scope and Limitations

### What This Documentation Covers ✓
- **Post-deployment troubleshooting** when performance tests fail
- **Client-side validation** of completed deployments
- **Platform-specific** acceleration issues (DirectML, NPU)
- **Common error resolution** for AI model execution
- **Integration guidance** with existing deployment workflows

### What This Documentation Does NOT Cover ✓
- **Initial system setup** (handled by deployment scripts)
- **Dependency installation** (handled by deployment scripts)
- **Model downloads** (handled by deployment scripts)
- **Virtual environment creation** (handled by deployment scripts)
- **Network configuration** (handled by deployment scripts)

## Key Corrections Made Based on Deployment Script Analysis

### Original Assumptions vs. Reality

| Original Assumption | Actual Reality |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Diagnostic framework handles setup | **Deployment scripts handle setup** |
| Tests run from development machine | **Tests must run ON client machines** |
| Framework provides installation | **Framework provides troubleshooting** |
| Generic testing approach | **Platform-specific testing built into deployment scripts** |

### Methodology Corrections Applied

1. **Performance Testing**: Both deployment scripts include built-in performance tests:
   - Intel: [`Test-IntelPerformance`](../../deployment/intel/scripts/prepare_intel.ps1#L2048-L2131)
   - Snapdragon: [`Test-Performance`](../../deployment/snapdragon/scripts/prepare_snapdragon.ps1#L814-L935) and [`Invoke-QuickBenchmark`](../../deployment/snapdragon/scripts/prepare_snapdragon.ps1#L938-L1015)

2. **Client-Side Requirement**: Documentation emphasizes that diagnostics must run **ON** the client machine where deployment occurred.

3. **Post-Deployment Focus**: Clear distinction between deployment (handled by scripts) and troubleshooting (handled by diagnostic framework).

## Usage Workflow Summary

### Correct Client Deployment Process
```
1. Run deployment script (prepare_intel.ps1 OR prepare_snapdragon.ps1)
   ↓
2. Deployment script runs built-in performance test
   ↓
3a. If performance test PASSES → Done!
3b. If performance test FAILS → Use diagnostic framework
   ↓
4. Run python demo_diagnostic.py --quick (on client machine)
   ↓
5. Follow platform-specific troubleshooting guidance
   ↓
6. Re-validate with diagnostic framework
```

### Error Resolution Priority
1. **Environment Issues** → Re-run deployment script
2. **Hardware Acceleration** → Use diagnostic framework debugging
3. **Performance Issues** → Platform-specific acceleration checks
4. **Model Loading** → Verify model integrity and paths

## Technical Accuracy Verification ✓

### Deployment Script Function References
- Intel performance testing: Line 2048-2131 in `prepare_intel.ps1`
- Snapdragon performance testing: Lines 814-935 and 938-1015 in `prepare_snapdragon.ps1`
- Model paths and sizes verified against deployment script comments
- Virtual environment paths verified against script constants

### Python Environment Requirements
- **Python Version**: 3.10 (enforced by both deployment scripts)
- **Virtual Environment**: Created by deployment scripts at `C:\AIDemo\venv\`
- **Package Dependencies**: Installed by deployment scripts
- **Platform Detection**: Available via existing `platform_detection.py`

### Hardware Acceleration Validation
- **Intel DirectML**: `torch_directml.device()` creation and tensor operations
- **Snapdragon QNN**: `onnxruntime.get_available_providers()` QNN provider check
- **Fallback Detection**: CPU execution provider usage monitoring
