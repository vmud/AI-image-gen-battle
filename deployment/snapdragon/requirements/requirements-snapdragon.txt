# Snapdragon X Elite (ARM64) Requirements
# NPU Acceleration Pipeline: ONNX Runtime + QNN Backend
# Platform: Windows 11 ARM64
# Target: 3-5 second generation times with INT8 models

# === INCLUDE CORE DEPENDENCIES ===
-r requirements-core.txt

# === SNAPDRAGON NPU ACCELERATION ===
# Qualcomm Neural Network backend for NPU acceleration
onnxruntime-qnn; platform_machine == "ARM64"

# Qualcomm AI Hub optimization tools
# Note: May require manual installation from Qualcomm Developer Portal
qai-hub; platform_machine == "ARM64"

# Windows Machine Learning for NPU support
winml>=1.0.0; sys_platform == "win32" and platform_machine == "ARM64"

# === ADDITIONAL SNAPDRAGON OPTIMIZATIONS ===
# ARM64-compatible packages that may provide additional optimizations
# opencv-python>=4.5.0  # Uncomment if needed for image processing

# === INSTALLATION NOTES FOR SNAPDRAGON ===
# 1. Install order: Core deps → Platform-specific → Verify NPU
# 2. Some Qualcomm packages may require manual download/installation
# 3. Fallback: Remove platform-specific packages and use CPU-only
# 4. Models: Download INT8 quantized models (~1.5GB total)
#
# Verification command:
# python -c "import onnxruntime as ort; print('QNN available:', 'QNNExecutionProvider' in ort.get_available_providers())"
